<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>Climate change is one of the most pressing debates of todays society, (most) scientists have come to the conclusion that if we don’t do something quickly, humanity is in serious danger from the consequences. We decided to look at what the root of this problem is, more specificly, which industrial sector is currently the biggest threat in the context of climate change. There are a few obvious contenders: many may think the biggest threat is fossil energy, or more generally the energy sector. We will try to see wether this is accurate or not by comparing the CO2 gas emissions of different
industries throughout the years. We have found two different perspectives:</p>
<p>Our first perspective on the topic is that it should be our priority to focus on the switch from fossil energy to
renewable energy sources. Fossil energy has a massive impact on climate change due to it’s large
amount of CO2 gas emission. Immediate action is required to look for greener energy
with lower amounts of CO2 gas emission. This would help slow down the climate change drastically.</p>
<p>Our second perspective is that our priority should not be to focus on the energy sector, but something
entirely different. For instance a while ago it came to light how big of an impact the meat
industry has on CO2 gas emissions across the world, because of how many acres of land
espescially cows need to be fed and kept. Examples like this lead us to believe that our priority should not be to focus on the energy sector in the endeavour to reduce CO2 gas emissions to fight the rapid climate change
happening right now.</p>

<h1>Dataset and Preprocessing<a class="headerlink" href="#dataset-and-preprocessing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>The dataset “Energy data 1990 - 2020.csv” contains information about different aspects of the energy production and consumption for different countries from 1990 to 2020, such as the share of wind/solar energy in the total energy production of a country in a certain year.</p>
<p>The dataset “historical_emissions.csv” contains information about the CO2 emissions of different industry sectors from different countries from 1990 to 2019, such as the CO2 emissions of the energy sector of a country in a certain year.</p>
<p>We did not preprocess the dataset “Energy data 1990 - 2020.csv” in any way.</p>
<p>We did preprocess the dataset “historical_emissions.csv” and saved the result as “historical_emissions (cleanest).csv”. The preprocessing of this dataset went as follows:</p>
<p>We removed all columns that only had one unique value. We also merged all rows that contained data about the same year but about different countries by summing up the CO2 emissions, so that we now had data about the global CO2 emissions instead of emissions of individual countries. Furthermore, we reorganised the data in a way that resembles a transposition: The original data had a unique column for every year, and had one column for all sectors with the value of that column for any row being the name of the sector about which that row contained data. But after our transformation, the dataset had one unique column for every sector, and had one column for all years with the value of that column for any row being the year about which that row contained data. Lastly, We merged the sectors “Energy” and “Electricity/Heat” by summing up their CO2 emission, because those sectors both belong to the energy production sector, which is the sector that we are interested in.</p>
<p>We did all this preprocessing with the code in the file “clean.ipynb”, which can be found in our GitHub online repository or in the table of contents to the left of this page under the header ‘Dataset and Preprocessing’.</p>

<h3>Argument 1<a class="headerlink" href="#argument-1" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Figure 1 shows an increasing trend of CO2 production per year of all the countries combined. The most shocking aspect of this graph is the fact that the increasing trend stays the same. In other words, the total emission of CO2 keeps rising at the same rate, with no sign of slowing down.This shows the urgency of developing a more efficient, more renewable and greener form of energy source to reduce the total emissions.</p>

<h3>Argument 2<a class="headerlink" href="#argument-2" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Figure 2 shows the average emission of each sector per year, with every sector given a different color. The energy sector shows to have the highest average emissions of CO2 per year, followed by the electricity/heat sector. Only using this graph already gives the implication that the energy sector is the biggest cause of CO2 emissions. (Furthermore, if the energy sector is to be compared with the electricity/heat sector, there could be a correlation between the two sectors based on the growth trend of the two sectors.)</p>

<h3>Argument 3<a class="headerlink" href="#argument-3" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Figure 3 displays a donut chart where all the sectors are shown with their contribution of CO2 emission. Again, energy is the biggest polluter, being responsible for almost a half of the total CO2 emissions from all the sectors combined. Based on this chart, if the world wants to emit less CO2, everyone should start with searching for greener options in the energy sector.</p>

<h3>Argument 1<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Figure 4 displays an area chart that gives us a good look at how the energy sector is already improng on using renewable energy sources, in the last 10 years almost 10% of energy produced has gotten renewable. This may not seem like a lot, but when you see that the trend is also rising, meaning that the growth is getting larger and larger each year, one can be positive-minded about the future of humanity. This shows that the energy sector is already working hard at finding greener sources, so to really make all the difference we might need to look elsewhere in sectors where this kind of development is not yet in full motion.</p>
</section>
<section id="id2">
<h3>Argument 2<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There is a reason that the energy sector is so big: we need energy for a lot of things and we can’t so easily use less energy, which means that we should be careful about setting limitations for how much energy we can produce. The only CO2 emissions from energy that we should try to decrease are the emissions that result from unneccessary energy production. However, there is only a small amount of energy that we produce but don’t use, as seen in figure 5. This means that there is only a small amount of unneccessary CO2 emissions that is caused by the energy sector: much less than one would initially expect.</p>
</section>
<section id="id3">
<h3>Argument 3<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The energy sector may be responsible for most CO2 emissions because of the sheer size of the sector, but the energy sector is already making big steps in reducing it’s CO2 emissions. In fact, the energy sector is reducing it’s CO2 emissions faster than most other sectors, as seen in figure 6. In the last ten years, it has been rare for the energy sector to have faster growing CO2 emissions than the average of all other sectors. The energy sector even shows a downward trend in it’s CO2 emission growth, whereas the average of all other sectors shows an upward trend. It seems that the energy sector is already making great progress in it’s CO2 emissions, and that we should in fact focus on the other sectors to stimulate a reduction in their CO2 emission growth.</p>
